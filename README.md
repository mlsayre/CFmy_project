CFmy_project
============

This is the repository containing my first CodeFellows project. The project showed us:

  1) we can run multiple servers on our machines
  2) we can install Ruby and Rails correctly on Ubuntu without suffering brain damage
  3) testing is good, Behaviour Driven Development is the way to go - even when spelled with a "u"
